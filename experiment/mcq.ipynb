      "Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed for every specific task. The core idea is that a system can improve its performance on a task over time as it is exposed to more data. The origins of machine learning trace back to the early 1950s, when computer scientist Arthur Samuel created a program that learned to play checkers, widely considered the first self-learning program. Around the same time, Alan Turing introduced the concept of machine intelligence with his famous Turing Test. In 1957, Frank Rosenblatt developed the \"Perceptron,\" the first neural network algorithm, inspired by the functioning of the human brain. Over the following decades, researchers developed key methods like the nearest neighbor algorithm and backpropagation for training multi-layer neural networks. However, progress was slow due to limited computing power and insufficient data.\n",

Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, is inspired by behavioral psychology, where agents learn to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties — this is how systems like AlphaGo and self-driving cars improve.
